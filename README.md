ðŸ§  K-Means Clustering on Mall Customer Data
This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The aim is to segment customers into clusters for better understanding of shopping behavior, which can help in targeted marketing.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps:
Loaded and explored the Mall_Customers.csv dataset.

Selected key features: Annual Income and Spending Score.

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Applied K-Means Clustering to segment the customers.

Visualized the clusters using matplotlib for better interpretation.

ðŸ“Š Result:
The final plot shows clear customer segments, helping businesses identify high spenders, average buyers, and potential targets for promotions.
